# Introduction

## About the gitbook

This is my **summary** of the course [**Clean Coding Principles**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-clean-coding-principles/table-of-contents) by **Cory House**.

In the course Cory House introduces the **disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of** **true software craftsmanship**.

In this gitbook I **summarize the key principles and strategies** I found most valuable in the course.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that I use C# code to illustrate the key points. The Clean Coding course applies on other languages as well (E.g: TypeScript, JavaScript, JAVA, etc...).
